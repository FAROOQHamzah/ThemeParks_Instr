Introduction:
(a) Descripitive Data
The data is written in the following manner: (1) English (2) Translated to Urdu (3) relevant category
For example:
(1) Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to [park name].
(2) خواتین و حضرات، [park name] میں خوش آمدید۔
(3) General announcements

(b) Real life problem : To accommodate visitors with different language backgrounds, theme parks often provide instructions in multiple languages. However, some languages may not be represented in the instructions, creating a language barrier for speakers of those languages. For example, theme parks in Hong Kong use English, Chinese, and Mandarin to provide instructions to the visitors. Visitors who speak languages other than English, such as Urdu, may not be able to understand the instructions if they aren't provided in their language. Our group is creating urdu voice translation announcements and instructions of different rides and activites for theme parks. We are doing this project to assist the visitors, who understand Urdu language. This can help improve the experiences of those visitors, for example confusion, frustration, and even accidents or injuries can be avoided.

Methodology:
Our team has created a data file after analyzing the common types of announcements and instructions on different theme park websities.

Discussion: 
There are certain advantages to offering Urdu announcements for Urdu-speaking visitors to the theme park. It may be useful in catering to Urdu-speaking visitors. The Urdu announcements welcome Urdu-speaking visitors to the park and can help to create a more inclusive environment for them. This will improve the visitor experience for Urdu-speaking visitors. Urdu announcements can help visitors who speak Urdu understand some of the most important park information and safety precautions. In addition, Urdu announcements promote inclusiveness, diversity, and acceptance of people from all linguistic backgrounds.

However, there are some limitations. The sentence pattern for English and Urdu are different. 
(i) Eng = Welcome to [park name].
(ii) Urd = [ میں خوش آمدید۔ [park name] ]
In this example, we can see that the name of the place in English comes in the end. In Urdu, the name of the place comes first. Another limitation is that as we used Google translate for Urdu translation, Google Translate may be unable to convey the subtle meanings and cultural differences that exist between languages, resulting in message misunderstandings or misinterpretations.
