Introduction:
(a) Descripitive Data
The data is written in the following manner: (1) English (2) Translated to Urdu (3) relevant category
For example:
(1) Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to [park name].
(2) خواتین و حضرات، [park name] میں خوش آمدید۔
(3) General announcements

(b) Real life problem : To accommodate visitors with different language backgrounds, theme parks often provide instructions in multiple languages. However, some languages may not be represented in the instructions, creating a language barrier for speakers of those languages. For example, theme parks in Hong Kong use English, Chinese, and Mandarin to provide instructions to the visitors.In addition,there are many ethnic minority groups living in Hong Kong such s Indian, Pakistani , Nepalese and others.Most of their languages share similar dialects with Urdu.Also, Urdu is an official language in both Pakistanand India , as well as a regional language in Nepal. Ethnic minority visitors who speak languages other than English, such as Urdu, may not be able to understand the instructions if they aren't provided in their language. Our group is creating urdu voice translation announcements and instructions of different rides and activites for theme parks. We are doing this project to assist the visitors, who understand Urdu language. It will cater to their needs and help to improve the experience of those visitors at the park by avoiding certain discomforting situtaions , for example confusion, frustration, and even accidents or injuries can be avoided.

Methodology:
Our team created a data file after analyzing the common announcements and instructions on different theme park websites.

Discussion: 
There are certain advantages to offering Urdu announcements for Urdu-speaking visitors to the theme park. It may be useful in catering to Urdu-speaking visitors. The Urdu announcements welcome Urdu-speaking visitors to the park and can help create a more inclusive environment. This will enhance the visitor's experience for Urdu-speaking visitors. Urdu announcements can help visitors who speak Urdu understand some of the most important park information and safety precautions. In addition, Urdu announcements promote inclusiveness, diversity, and acceptance of people from all linguistic backgrounds.Our audio datas and set of instructions are generic.They can be used by all of the theme parks.They just have to change the names of places, the time and numbers of restricted height, weight or age.

However, there are some limitations. The sentence patterns for English and Urdu are different. 
(i) Eng = Welcome to [park name].
(ii) Urd = [ میں خوش آمدید۔ [park name] ]
In this example, we can see that the name of the place in English comes in the end. In Urdu, the name of the place comes first. Another limitation is that as we used Google translate for Urdu translation, Google Translate may be unable to convey the subtle meanings and cultural differences that exist between languages, resulting in message misunderstandings or misinterpretations. 
The grammar properties for each language are different, thus there might be wrong grammar during translation of instructions.

Effectiveness: 
This solution can provide effective communication between visitors and theme parks' staff, and give them a wonderful experience at the park.
